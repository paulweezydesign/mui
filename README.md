Supercharge your new Material-UI project with Mui Treasury Layout.

v5 just came out in May 2021 with new improvements.

- Bundle sizes reduced by ~30% compare to v4 (another 20kb! reduced because material-ui will drop JSS)
- Add more examples
- Support global theme

v4 just came out in May 2020 with whole new cool stuffs.

- Reduce JS calculation and leverage css-in-js for server side rendering (no more blip at first paint)
- Keep the library lean as much as possible. Get rid of lodash and don't rely on specific css-in-js lib (jss is still used internally in Material-UI, so we cannot remove it)
- Improve developer experience by rewriting with typescript and design new API
- Add more documentation & troubleshoot requested from developers (thanks everyone)
- Reduce bundle size and make it tree shakeable!
